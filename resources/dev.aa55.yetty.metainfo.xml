    <p>yeTTY is an open source application for embedded developers to
    view logs from serial port.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text highlighting</li>yeTTY uses KDEâ€™s KTextEditor for
      displaying the logs. KTextEditor provides yeTTY with syntax
      highlighting and text search.
      <li>Auto reconnection</li>In case your board gets disconnected,
      yeTTY will keep on attempting to reconnect to the same port.
      <li>Audio alert on string match</li>yeTTY can monitor the
      output for a specified keyword and alert you with a sound upon
      match.
      <li>Long term run mode</li>This is useful if you need to keep
      the board running overnight. yeTTY will capture the logs from
      serial port and compress it and save them to storage.
      <li>Suspend during flashing</li>If your board uses the same
      serial port for both logs and flashing, prepend the flashing
      command with yetty_suspend to suspend yeTTY while the board is
      being flashed.
      <li>Auto baud rate detection</li>yeTTY can attempt to
      automatically detect the baud rate by trying out different baud
      rates till it finds one with readable ASCII text.
    </ul>
